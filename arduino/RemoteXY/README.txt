This is the library to remote control The AirBoard from a
smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth 2

Download the Android app from the 
website: http://remotexy.com/download/ to connect to this library.
    
Use the website http://remotexy.com/ to create your own management 
interface to The AirBoard with your smartphone or tablet.
You can create different management interfaces. Use buttons, 
switches, sliders, joysticks (g-sensor) all colors and sizes 
in its interface. Next, you will be able to get the sample 
code for Arduino/The AirBoard to use your interface for control from a 
smartphone or tablet. You will not need to re-install the 
android app, as it will determine which interface you have 
downloaded the arduino.
  
The AirBoard is a thumb-size, Arduino-compatible, wireless, low-power,
ubiquitous computer designed to sketch Internet-of-Things, fast!
